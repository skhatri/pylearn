#Homework - 1
#Create a program that can help a user perform exponential calculations.
# The program should ask user for the value of first number and then the second number.
# It should calculate the result of first number to the power of second number.
"""
Example:

    Enter value of x: 2
    Enter value of y: 3
    2 to the power of 3 is 8

#Homework - 2
#Create another program which asks the user for temperature in Farenheit and prints the celcius result
"""
Example:

Enter temperature in Farenheit: 99.5
Celcius equivalent of 99.5 Farenheit is 37.5
Thank you for using my temperature calculator
"""

#Note: the input temperatures have to be stored in variables and the calculator should
#work for any given input, not just 37.5 and 99.5.

#Homework - 3
#Create a program which prompts the user for a diameter of a circle. It then calculates and prints the area of the circle.
"""
Example

Enter diameter of the circle: 6

The radius of the circle is: 3
The area of the circle is: 28.27
The perimeter of the circle is: 18.84
